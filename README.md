Working on creating a web application that tracks the delays between the schedule time and the actual start time of NBA games. This is a project that is important to me as I find the NBA often wastes the consumer's time with this and it would be great to accumulate real-life data. 
Through this application a user has the chance to:
- log the games they've watched
- see the total amount of time they've lost waiting for games
In the future I'm looking to implement: 
- saved user data to track as the season goes on
- previous season's data as well
